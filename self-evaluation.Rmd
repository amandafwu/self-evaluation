### Overall Impression
 
Although this class was really difficult as I had little to no experience with R and very little knowledge about statistics, I thought this class was really, really valuable in teaching me these statistic skills that I need for future research. I definitely struggled with some of the concepts at times but I think I learned the best by applying the modules and attempting to solve the homework by myself. Although it can be really frustrating, the satisfaction of finishing my coding homework makes me believe that I've learned enough of the basics to apply R in different settings, whether in future research or in other classes.

Additionally, replace the `The following self evaluation...` text below your GIF with a three sentence summary of your experience in the class and what you take away from it to accompany that GIF. You may also choose a catchy title.
